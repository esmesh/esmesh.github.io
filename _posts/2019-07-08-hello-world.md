I don't plan to use the "blog posts" portion of the website much, but I'm going to go ahead and set it up in case I change my mind later. Since part of doing that is making sure that adding posts works, I might as well start with a traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program" target="_blank">"Hello, World!"</a>.
